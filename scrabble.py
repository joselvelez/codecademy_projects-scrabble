We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.
Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.
'''
letters_to_points = {letter:point for letter, point in zip(letters, points)}
#print(letters_to_points)
'''
Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.
'''
letters_to_points[" "] = 0
'''
We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.
Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.
'''
def score_word(word):
    point_total = 0
    for letter in word:
        point_total += letters_to_points.get(letter,0)
    return point_total
'''
Create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a list of the words they have played.
'''
player_to_words = {
    "player1": ["BLUE", "TENNIS", "EXIT", "try"],
    "wordNerd": ["EARTH", "EYES", "MACHINE"],
    "Lexi Con": ["ERASER", "BELLY", "HUSKY"],
    "Prof Reader": ["ZAP", "COMA", "PERIOD"]
    }
player_to_points = {}
'''
Iterate through the list of players and their words to tally their points and populate the data in the player_to_points dictionary
'''
def update_point_totals():
    for player, words in player_to_words.items():
        player_points = 0
        for word in words:
            player_points += score_word(word)
        player_to_points[player] = player_points
'''
Write a function that would take in a player and a word, and add that word to the list of words theyâ€™ve played
'''
def play_word(player, word):
    player_to_words[player].append(word)
    update_point_totals()
play_word('player1', 'TEST')
#print(player_to_words)

print(player_to_points)
